# lil-git-helper-4-crealo

> This tiny little helper is for commiting changes to the [Crealo](https://github.com/crealoteam) project (they're all private ðŸ‘€).

The commit message needs to be in the following format:

```txt
[feat|fix|chores|test](scope): message
```

So I made this little helper to make it easier to commit changes to the Crealo project.
